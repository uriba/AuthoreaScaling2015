\section{Discussion}
We construct a parsimonious model connecting protein concentration levels and the growth rate as an outcome of the limited bio-synthesis resources of cells. 
We re-introduce the notion of intrinsic affinity for expression, first presented in \cite{Maaloe1969}, and rarely used ever since, as a key determinant for the differences in expression of different proteins under a given growth condition.
We show that integrating the notion intrinsic affinity for expression with the limited bio-synthesis capacity of cells results in a simple mechanism predicting increased concentration of many proteins with the growth rate, without assuming the existence of specific transcription factors regulation.

\section{Discussion}
We constructed a parsimonious model connecting protein concentration levels and the growth rate as an outcome of the limited bio-synthesis resources of cells. 
The notion of intrinsic affinity for expression, first presented in \cite{Maaloe1969}, and rarely used ever since, was re-introduced as a key determinant for the differences in expression of different proteins under a given growth condition.
The integration of the notion of intrinsic affinity for expression with the limited bio-synthesis capacity of cells was shown to result in a simple mechanism predicting increased concentration of many proteins with the growth rate, without assuming regulation by specific transcription factors.

\subsubsection{Normalizing protein fractions across conditions}
\label{concacrossconds} 
Our analysis aims at identifying proteins that share similar expression patterns across the different growth conditions.
For example, consider two proteins, $A$ and $B$ measured under two conditions, $c_1$ and $c_2$.
Assume that the measured fractions out of the proteome of these two proteins under the two conditions were $0.001$ and $0.002$ for $A$ under $c_1$ and $c_2$ respectively, and $0.01$ and $0.02$ for $B$ under $c_1$ and $c_2$ respectively.
These two proteins therefore share identical responses across the two conditions, namely, they double their fraction in the proteome in $c_2$ compared with $c_1$.

The normalization procedure scales the data so as to reveal this identity in response.
Dividing the fraction of each protein out of the proteome by the average fraction of that protein across conditions yields the normalized response.
It the example, the average fraction of $A$ across the different conditions is $0.0015$ and the average fraction of $B$ is $0.015$.
Thus, dividing the fraction of every protein by the average fraction across conditions of that same protein yields:
\[
A'_{c_1}=\frac{A_{c_1}}{\bar{A}}=\frac{0.001}{0.0015}=\frac{2}{3}=\frac{0.01}{0.015}=\frac{B_{c_1}}{\bar{B}}=B'_{c_1}
\]
for $c_1$ and:
\[
A'_{c_2}=\frac{A_{c_2}}{\bar{A}}=\frac{0.002}{0.0015}=\frac{4}{3}=\frac{0.02}{0.015}=\frac{B_{c_2}}{\bar{B}}=B'_{c_2}
\]
for $c_2$ showing $A$ and $B$ share identical responses across $c_1$ and $c_2$.

The general normalization procedure thus divides the fraction of protein $i$ under condition $c$, $p_i(c)$ by the average fraction of protein $i$ across all of the conditions in the data set, $\bar{p}_i$, to give the normalized fraction under condition $c$, $p'_i(c)=\frac{p_i(c)}{\bar{p}_i}$.

This normalization procedure has been applied prior to calculating the slopes of the regression lines best describing the change in fraction out of the proteome of every protein as a function of the growth rate.
Furthermore, when analyzing the variability explained by linear regression on the sum of fractions of all proteins presenting a high correlation with the growth rate, the same normalization procedure was made in order to avoid domination by the high abundance of a few proteins in that group.

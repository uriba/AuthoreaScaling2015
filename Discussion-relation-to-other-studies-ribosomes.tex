Many studies monitored the ribosome concentration in cells and its interdependence with growth rate \cite{Scott2010,Schaechter1958,Bremer,Zaslaver2009,Bremer1987}.
While in all of these studies a linear dependence of ribosome concentration with growth rate was observed, in some cases different response strengths were found, compared with the observations in this study.
A discussion for various reasons that may underlie these differences is in \ref{ribosomeconc}.
Conducting similar analysis on the data sets used in this study reveals that, while a linear relation exists, it is not unique to ribosomal proteins but is in fact shared among many more genes.
Furthermore, the variability in the concentration levels of proteins explained by linear correlation with growth rate is similar among the ribosomal proteins versus all the proteins with high correlation with the growth rate as is shown in Figure \ref{fig:ribsnonribs}.

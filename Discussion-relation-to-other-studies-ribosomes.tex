Many studies monitored the ribosome concentration in cells and its interdependence with growth rate \cite{Scott2010,Schaechter1958,Bremer,Zaslaver2009,Bremer1987}.
While in all of these studies a linear dependence of ribosome concentration with growth rate was observed, in some cases different parameters were found to describe this linear dependence, compared with the observations in our study.
A discussion of various reasons that may underlie these differences is given in section \ref{ribosomeconc}.
Conducting similar analysis on the data sets used in this study reveals that, while a linear relation exists, it is not unique to ribosomal proteins but is in fact shared among many more genes.
Furthermore, the linear dependence slope and explained variability of concentration levels of proteins explained by linear correlation with growth rate is similar among the ribosomal proteins versus all the proteins with high correlation with the growth rate as is shown in Figure \ref{fig:ribsnonribs}.

\subsubsection{The concentration of a non-differentially regulated protein is expected to increase with the growth rate} 
Recalling that the connection between the growth rate and the doubling time is: $g(c)=\frac{\ln(2)}{\tau(c)}$, we now combine Equation \ref{eq:concentration-ratio} with Equation \ref{eq:gr-ratio} to get that:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:default-response}
  p_i(c)=\frac{w_i(c)}{\sum_jw_j(c)}=\frac{w_i(c)}{W_B}\frac{W_B}{\sum_jw_j(c)}=\frac{w_i(c)}{W_B}\frac{T_B}{\ln(2)}g(c)
\end{equation}

Incorporating all the condition-independent constants ($W_B$, $T_B$, $\ln(2)$) into one term, $A$, we get that the predicted fraction of protein $i$ out of the proteome under condition $c$ is:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:final-conc}
  p_i(c)=Aw_i(c)g(c)
\end{equation}
which implies that, for every two conditions between which gene $i$ maintains its affinity, ($w_i(c_1)=w_i(c_2)$), the fraction protein $i$ occupies out of the proteome scales in the same way as the growth rate does between these two conditions.

To summarize, the simplified model we have constructed predicts that, under no specific regulation, the fraction a protein occupies out of the proteome should scale with the growth rate.
A group of such proteins should therefore maintain their relative concentrations across conditions.

The findings in this study support and broaden the findings in other recent studies.
Specifically, for \emph{S.cerevisiae} a few recent studies found that the concentration of the majority of the proteins is coordinated across conditions and increases with growth rate \cite{Keren2013a,Gasch2000,Brauer2008a}.
In principle, the model we suggest here can be applied to any exponentially growing population of cells and may thus also serve as a potential explanation for the phenomena observed in these studies and others.

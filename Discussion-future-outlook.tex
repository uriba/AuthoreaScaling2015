The expected availability of increasing amounts of whole proteome data sets, with higher accuracy levels, will enable further investigation of the details of cellular resource distribution.
The analysis of such future data sets will shed more light on the relative roles of carefully tuned response mechanisms versus global, passive effects in shaping the proteome composition under different growth environments.

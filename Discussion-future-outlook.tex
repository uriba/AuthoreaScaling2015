The expected availability of increasing amounts of whole proteome data sets, with higher accuracy levels, following advances in experimental methods and measurement techniques, will enable further investigation of the details of cellular resource distribution and the responses microorganisms have for various environmental changes.
The analysis of such future data sets will shed more light on the relative roles of carefully tuned response mechanisms versus global, passive effects in shaping the proteome composition under different growth environments.

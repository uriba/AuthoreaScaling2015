\subsection{Theoretical model}
What is the simplest way to explain a coordinated growth rate dependence of a large group of proteins, that is, can such a behavior be explained without invoking parameter tuning or complex layers of regulation?
In an attempt to parsimoniously explain such a wide-spread, coordinated, positive response, we have constructed a minimalistic model that is able to predict such a behavior as an outcome of redistribution of resources of the bio-synthesis machinery.
Before presenting the model mathematically, we give a brief intuitive depiction.

The model assumes that, under favorable growth conditions, the cell actively down-regulates some proteins that are needed in harsher conditions, as is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:model}.
As a result, the fraction of each of the rest of the proteins out of the proteome increases, showing the same relative ratios, as long as there is no specific regulation.
The growth rate thus increases, as the ratio of bio-synthetic machinery to the rest of the proteome increases, as is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:model}B.
To demonstrate the idea concretely, one could think about the down regulation of the lac operon in the presence of Glucose, that alleviates the need to transcribe and translate lactose metabolism genes and coincides with faster growth.

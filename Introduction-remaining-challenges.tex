Despite these advancements, many gaps remain in our understanding of the connection between gene expression and growth rate, primarily regarding the underlying mechanisms.
Are there unique factors controlling specific groups of genes, as is suggested by \cite{You_2013,Peebo_2015,Hui_2015,Bosdriesz_2015} and others, or is there a more global phenomenon shared across most genes in the genome?
What fraction of the variability observed in gene expression patterns across different growth conditions results from active adaptation to the specific condition?
To what extent are large clusters of genes regulated by ''master regulator'' factors such as cAMP, and how much by global, gene and condition-independent, response?
Genome-wide proteomic data sets, which probe the proteome composition at different growth rates, offer potential insights into these questions and can serve as a basis to explore and compare different models of regulation \cite{Valgepea2013,Heinemann2015,Hui_2015,Peebo_2015}.

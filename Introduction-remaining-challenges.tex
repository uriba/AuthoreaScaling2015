Despite these advancements, many gaps remain in our understanding of the connection between gene expression and growth rate.
Primarily, it is unclear what mechanisms underlie the interconnection between gene expression and growth rate.
Are there unique mechanisms and factors controlling specific groups of genes or is there a more global phenomenon shared across most genes in the genome?
What fraction of the variability observed in gene expression patterns across different growth conditions results from active adaptation to the specific condition?
To what extent large clusters of genes are regulated by ''master regulator'' factors such as cAMP, and how much results from global, gene and condition-independent, response?
Genome-wide proteomic data sets, such as those generated by mass-spectrometry, which probe the proteome composition at different growth rates, offer potential insights into these questions.

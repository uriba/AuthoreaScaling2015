\subsubsection{Changes in the proteome across environmental conditions are dominated by proteins that are positively correlated with growth rate}
Lastly, we assessed the significance of the positive correlation with growth rate of proteins, out of the total change in proteome composition across conditions.
To that end, we summed the concentrations of all of the proteins that are strongly correlated with growth rate across the conditions measured and plotted their total concentration against the growth rate in Figure \ref{fig:globalgrcorr}.
Both data sets show that the concentration of these proteins change significantly across the different conditions ($\approx 2$ fold change in total concentration across $\approx 5$ fold change of the growth rate).
Moreover, most of the variability of the total concentration of these proteins can be explained by the growth rate ($R^2$ of $0.79$ in H and $0.99$ in V). 
For further analysis of the differences between the two data sets see section \ref{heinemannchemo}.
Importantly, the strongly correlated proteins form a large fraction of the proteome mass-wise, exceeding $50\%$ of the proteome at the higher growth rates measured.
Thus, when considering the changes in proteome composition across conditions, we find that, at higher growth rates, more than $50\%$ of the proteome composition is affected by the positive correlation with growth rate of the same group of proteins.

However, despite the magnitude of this phenomena, when calculating the fraction of the total variability in the proteome that is accounted for by this linear response, we observe that only $\approx 9\%$ of the change in the proteome composition across conditions results from scaling with growth rate of these proteins.
Further discussion of the fraction of variability explained can be found in \ref{corrthreshold}.
The errors in current whole proteome measurement techniques make it difficult to distinguish between proteins that scale coordinately, as is predicted by our model, and proteins that scale differentially, but within the measurement error.
Thus, it is unclear how prevalent the effect we predict is versus individual up regulation with growth rate.
We expect future improvements in the accuracy of whole proteome measurements to enable further quantification of this phenomena.

\subsection{Additional figures of simulated and randomized data sets}
The maximal explained variability in data sets with shuffled protein abundances is significantly smaller than in the real data sets as is seen in figure \ref{fig:shuffledexpvar}.

A simulated data set, assuming half of the proteins scale linearly with growth rate with normalized intercept at $0.5$, similar to the intercept found in the data analysis, and with simulated normally distributed noise levels of $25\%$, result in distributions similar to those found in the original data analysis (Figure \ref{fig:simulated})

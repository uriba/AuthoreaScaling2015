\subsection{Differences between the correlations found in the two data sets}
\label{heinemannchemo} 

The lower correlation and higher variability found in the data set from \cite{Heinemann2014} partially results from the variability in the conditions it contains as well as the higher number of conditions measured across a similar range of growth rates.
Specifically, as this data set includes measurements under different carbon sources, as opposed to the data set from \cite{Valgepea2013}, that uses the same carbon source on all measurements, a larger variability in expression patterns is expected.
Restricting the analysis of the data set from \cite{Heinemann2014} only to chemostat conditions supports this suggestion and shows much less variability as is shown in Figure \ref{fig:growthcorrchemo}.

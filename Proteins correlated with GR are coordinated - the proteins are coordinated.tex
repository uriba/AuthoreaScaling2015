In order to examine how similar the behavior with growth rate is for the group of proteins that we found to be strongly positively correlated with growth rate, we divided the concentration of every such protein, in every condition, by its average concentration across all of the conditions (see \ref{concacrossconds} for further details).
The resulting normalized concentrations across conditions represent the concentrations of the specific protein under every condition, relative to its mean concentration across all conditions facilitating comparisons between proteins with differing expression levels.
Next, we calculated the slope of a linear regression line for the normalized concentration vs. the growth rate for every one of these proteins and plotted the result in Figure \ref{fig:globalfit}.
The resulting distributions reveal that the slopes of $\approx \frac{2}{3}$ of the proteins lie in the range $(0.5,2)$ and that the highest slopes are $\approx 5$.
A slope of $0.5$ means that the concentration of the protein changes by $\pm12\%$ around its average concentration in the range of growth rates measured, whereas a slope of $2$ indicates a change of $\pm50\%$ in the same range of growth rates.

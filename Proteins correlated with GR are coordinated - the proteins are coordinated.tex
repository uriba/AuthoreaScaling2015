To assess the coordination between the proteins that were found to be strongly positively correlated with growth rate we therefore calculated the slope of a linear regression line for the normalized concentration vs. the growth rate for every one of these proteins and plotted the result in Figure \ref{fig:globalfit}.
The resulting distribution reveals that, not only is a significant fraction of the proteome strongly positively correlated with the growth rate, but that this response is also coordinated between the different proteins.

\subsubsection{Slower biological processes rates at slower growth affect the relation between proteome composition and growth rate}
The simplified model assumes that the doubling time is proportional to the ratio of total protein to bio-synthetic protein.
This assumption fails if the rate at which each biosynthetic machine operates changes across conditions.
Replacing this assumption by an interdependence of bio-synthesis rate with growth rate (such that, the faster the growth, the faster the synthesis rates, per machine), will affect the resulting predictions as well.
Slower bio-synthesis rates under slower growth rates imply that, compared with the model prediction, higher fraction of bio-synthesis proteins is needed to achieve a given growth rate.
Thus, lower synthesis rates under slower growth rates will be reflected by a lower slope and higher interception point for non-regulated proteins than those predicted by the constant-rate version of the model.

Early on it was found that the expression of some genes is coordinated with growth rate, rather than with the specific environment.
Classic experiments in bacteria have shown that ribosome concentration increases in proportion to growth rate \cite{Schaechter1958}.
The observed increase in concentration has been interpreted as an increased need for ribosomes at faster growth rates \cite{Neidhardt1999,Dennis2004,Zaslaver2009}.
The search for underlying mechanisms in \emph{E.coli} yielded several candidates such as the pools of ppGpp and iNTP \cite{Murray_2003,Bosdriesz_2015}, and the tRNA pools through the stringent response \cite{Chatterji2001,Brauer2008a}.
For a more thorough review see \cite{Nomura1984}.

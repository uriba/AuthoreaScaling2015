We re-introduce the notion of intrinsic affinity for expression, first presented in \cite{Maaloe1969}, and rarely used ever since.
We show that integrating this notion with the limited bio-synthesis capacity of cells results in a parsimonious mechanism that can explain the response observed in recent experimental data, data that was unavailable at the time this notion was first introduced, nearly 50 years ago.

\subsection{Analysis including LB condition}
Due to the fast growth rate under LB, compared with the other conditions measured in the data set from \cite{Heinemann2015} it was not included in our primary analysis as was noted in section \ref{heinemanncond}.
Figure \ref{fig:LB} shows the implications of including LB in the analysis.
As can be seen, many proteins are now less correlated with growth rate due to down regulation under LB.
However, despite having fewer proteins being strongly positively correlated with growth (525 vs. 628) and despite the accumulated fraction of these proteins being lower under the slower growth conditions ($\approx20\%$ vs. $\approx25\%$), these proteins do occupy $>50\%$ out of the proteome under fast growth in LB.

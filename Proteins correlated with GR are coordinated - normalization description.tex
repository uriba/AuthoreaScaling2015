In order to compare the responses of different proteins across conditions, we therefore, for every protein, divided its concentration under every condition by its average concentration across all of the conditions (see \ref{concacrossconds} for further details).
This normalized concentration across conditions represents the concentration of the specific protein under every condition, relative to its mean concentration across all conditions.
We note that, under this metric, sharing similar responses among a group of proteins implies that proteins in that group maintain their relative ratios, ratios that are determined by the average concentration of each of these proteins across the different environmental conditions.
We refer to proteins that share a similar normalized response across different conditions as being \emph{coordinated} or \emph{coordinately regulated}.

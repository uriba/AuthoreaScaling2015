Other recently published studies in \emph{E.coli} have suggested different models and in some cases have results  and predictions that do not coincide with those presented in this study.
Notably, in \cite{Klumpp2009a} the opposite behavior for unregulated genes is predicted.
A few differences can explain this seeming discrepancy, among which are different ranges of growth rates observed (the growth rates in this study lie in a range smaller than the growth rates in \cite{Klumpp2009a}), different strains used and very different methods for deducing the expected behavior (ref SI for further discussion?).

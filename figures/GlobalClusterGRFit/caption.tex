\label{fig:globalgrcorr}
Fraction of the proteome occupied by proteins that are strongly positively correlated with growth rate.
The accumulated sum of the proteins that are strongly positively correlated with growth rate (defined as having a correlation above $0.5$), as a fraction out of the proteome, with linear regression lines is shown.
These proteins form a large fraction ($\ge 50\%$) out of the proteome at higher growth rates.
The accumulated fraction of the strongly correlated proteins doubles as the growth rate changes by about 5-fold.
Assuming constant degradation rates, the trend lines correspond to protein half life times of $\approx 1.7$ hours.
Randomized data sets result in much fewer strongly positively correlated with growth rate proteins, implyin a much smaller accumulated fraction (hollow circles) as is further discussed in section \ref{randanalysis}

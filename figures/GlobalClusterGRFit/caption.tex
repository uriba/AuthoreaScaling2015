The sum of the concentrations of the strongly correlated proteins (defined as having a correlation above 0.8 for the V data set and a correlation above 0.25 for the H data set) in each of the data sets, with linear regression lines, is shown.
These proteins form a large fraction ($>50\%$) out of the proteome at higher growth rates.
The change in the concentration of the strongly correlated proteins follows trend lines with slopes of $\approx 0.6$ meaning their total concentration doubles itself as the growth rate changes by about 5-fold.
Assuming constant degradation rates, these trend lines correspond to protein half life times of 1.3 and 2 hours for the Heinemann and Valgepea data sets respectively.

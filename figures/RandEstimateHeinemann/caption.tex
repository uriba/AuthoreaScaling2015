\label{fig:randpred}
  A selection of random predictions of protein concentrations from the highly correlated with growth rate fraction, taken from the data set of \cite{Heinemann2015}.
  Each panel shows the average concentration of 10 random proteins that are highly correlated with growth (blue dots), a regression line that best fits the data, and the concentration of a different random protein (green dots).
  The $R^2$ value for the trend line and the different protein is given.

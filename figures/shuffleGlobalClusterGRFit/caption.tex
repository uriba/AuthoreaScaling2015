The fraction out of the proteome of the proteins that are highly correlated with growth rate in shuffled data sets.
In each data set, the amount of every protein was shuffled across the different growth conditions.
As much fewer proteins are strongly positively correlated with the growth rate in the shuffled data set, their total fraction out of the proteome is also much smaller compared with the original data sets.

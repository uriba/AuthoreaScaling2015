\label{fig:model}
A minimalistic model predicts that low expression of condition-dependent genes under permissive growth environment, compared with a challenging environment, implies larger fraction of all other proteins.
With this, the ratio of bio-synthesis genes to the rest of the proteome is higher in permissive environments, resulting in faster growth.

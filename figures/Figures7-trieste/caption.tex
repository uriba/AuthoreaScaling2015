\label{fig:model}
A minimalistic model predicts that low expression of environmental genes under permissive growth conditions, compared with challenging conditions, implies larger fraction of all other proteins.
With this, the ratio of bio-synthesis machinery genes to the rest of the proteome is higher in permissive environments, resulting in faster growth.

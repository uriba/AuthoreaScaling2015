The predictions of the model for the fraction of unregulated proteins as a function of the growth rate.
The effects of accounting for protein degradation (green) and Michaelis-Menten like dependence of biosynthesis rates on growth rate (red) are shown.
For non-constant biosynthesis rate, a growth rate of 0.2 was selected as the growth rate at which the biosynthesis rate is half of its maximal value.

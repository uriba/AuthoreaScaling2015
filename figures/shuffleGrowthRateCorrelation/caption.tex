\label{fig:shuffledcorr}
The Pearson correlation with growth rate of the fraction out of the proteome of proteins for a shuffled fraction across conditions.
In each data set, the amount of every protein was shuffled across the different growth conditions.
The shuffling procedure creates a data set that has much fewer proteins that are significantly positively correlated with growth rate, compared with the original data sets.

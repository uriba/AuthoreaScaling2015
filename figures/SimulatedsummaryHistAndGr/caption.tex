\label{fig:simulated}
A simulated data set, assuming half of the proteins are prefectly correlated with growth rate and half are fixed, with simulated noise level of $25\%$.
Average protein concentrations, growth rates and normalized slope of the correlated proteins are based on the data set from \cite{Heinemann2015}.
The normalized intercept of the correlated proteins was set to $0.5$ in accordance with the intercept found in the original data analysis.
The results are similar to those obtained for the real data set, showing that if the model is valid, the expected results would be similar to those we obtained.

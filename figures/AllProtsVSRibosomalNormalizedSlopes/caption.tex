    Histogram of the slopes of regression lines for every protein that is highly correlated with growth, for the two data sets analyzed.
    Ribosomal proteins are marked in green on top of the non ribosomal proteins, marked in blue.
    Proteins concentrations were normalized to account for differences in slopes resulting from differing average concentrations (See text and section \ref{concacrossconds}).
    The expected distribution of slopes given the experimental noise, assuming all proteins are coordinated, is plotted in red.
    Left panel - data from \cite{Valgepea2013}, right panel - data from \cite{Heinemann2014}.
    High correlation proteins share similar normalized slopes, implying they are coordinated, maintaining their relative ratios across conditions (see text/methods for further details).
    Ribosomal proteins scale with growth rate in a manner similar to the rest of the high correlation proteins.

\label{fig:threshold}
  Statistics on the explained variability in the normalized data set as a function of the threshold used for defining strong correlation with growth rate.
  An optimal threshold is a threshold that maximizes the fraction of explained variability in the proteome by linear regression on proteins that have a correlation with growth rate that exceeds the threshold (blue line).
  The maximal explained variability in each data set is marked as a horizontal dashed line and is $\hMaxExpVar{}\%$ (obtained given a threshold of $0.25$) for the data set from \cite{Heinemann2015}, and $\vMaxExpVar{}\%$ (obtained given a threshold of $0.2$) in the data from \cite{Peebo_2015}.

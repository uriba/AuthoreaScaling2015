\label{fig:threshold}
  Statistics on the explained variability in the normalized data set as a function of the threshold used for defining strong correlation with growth rate.
  An optimal threshold is a threshold that maximizes the fraction of explained variability in the proteome by linear regression on proteins that have a correlation with growth rate that exceeds the threshold (blue line).
  The maximal explained variability is $9\%$ for the data set from \cite{Heinemann2015} and is obtained given a threshold of $0.25$.
  For the data set from \cite{Valgepea2013} the maximal explained variability is $4\%$ and it is obtained by choosing a threshold of $0.8$.

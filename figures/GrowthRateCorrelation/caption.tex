\label{fig:growthcorr}
A strong positive Pearson correlation between the fraction out of the proteome and the growth rate is observed for a large number of proteins in the two data sets analyzed (thresholds used for high correlation are marked in dashed lines and further discussed in \ref{corrthreshold}).
These proteins span many functional groups.

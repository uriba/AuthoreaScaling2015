\label{fig:growthcorr}
The concentrations of a large fraction of the proteins have a strong positive Pearson correlation with the growth rate in the two data sets analyzed (thresholds used for high correlation are marked in dashed lines and further discussed in \ref{corrthreshold}).
These proteins span many functional groups.

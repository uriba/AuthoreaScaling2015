\label{fig:growthcorr}
A strong positive Pearson correlation between the fraction out of the proteome and the growth rate is observed for a large number of proteins in the two data sets analyzed. Thresholds used for high correlation are marked in dashed lines and further discussed in \ref{corrthreshold}.
Functional groups are denoted by different colors.

\label{fig:growthcorr}
A strong positive Pearson correlation of the concentration with the growth rate is observed for a large fraction of the proteins in the two data sets analyzed (thresholds used for high correlation are marked in dashed lines and further discussed in \ref{corrthreshold}).
These proteins span many functional groups.

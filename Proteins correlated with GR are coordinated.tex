\subsubsection{Proteins positively correlated with growth rate share a similar response}
\label{propchange} 

Following the identification of the group of proteins strongly positively correlated with growth rate, we examined how similar is the behavior with growth rate for these different proteins.
We note that similar correlation with growth rate for different proteins does not imply that such proteins share the same scaling with growth rate, that is,  they may have very different slopes or fold changes with an increasing growth rate.

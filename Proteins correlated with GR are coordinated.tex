\subsubsection{Proteins positively correlated with growth rate share a similar response}
\label{propchange} 
Our model predicts that non-differentially regulated proteins, whose fraction out of the proteome increases with growth rate, should preserve their relative abundances across conditions.
We therefore examined how similar is the behavior with growth rate for the group of proteins that we found  to be strongly positively correlated with growth rate.
We refer to proteins that preserve their relative abundances across different conditions as being \emph{coordinated} or \emph{coordinately regulated}.
We note that similar correlation with growth rate for different proteins does not imply that such proteins are coordinated, i.e. that they share the same scaling with growth rate.
Theoretically, proteins with identical correlation with growth rate may have very different slopes or fold changes with an increasing growth rate.

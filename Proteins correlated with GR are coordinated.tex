\subsubsection{Proteins positively correlated with growth rate share a similar response}
\label{propchange} 
Our model predicts that non-differentially regulated proteins, whose fraction out of the proteome increases with growth rate, should preserve their relative abundances across conditions.
We refer to such proteins as being \emph{coordinated} or \emph{coordinately regulated}.
We have shown above that many proteins are positively correlated with growth rate.
However, we note that having similar correlation with growth rate for different proteins does not imply that such proteins are coordinated, i.e. that they share the same scaling with growth rate.
Theoretically, proteins with identical correlation with growth rate may have very different slopes or fold changes with an increasing growth rate.

\subsubsection{Proteins positively correlated with growth rate share a similar response}
\label{propchange} 
Our model predicts that non-differentially regulated proteins, whose fraction out of the proteome increases with growth rate, should preserve their relative abundances across conditions.
We therefore examined how similar is the behavior with growth rate for the group of proteins that we found  to be strongly positively correlated with growth rate.
We note that similar correlation with growth rate for different proteins does not imply that such proteins share the same scaling with growth rate, that is, they may have very different slopes or fold changes with an increasing growth rate.

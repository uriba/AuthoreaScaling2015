Interestingly, our model demonstrates that no specific control mechanisms need to exist in order to achieve a linear correlation between ribosomal proteins and the growth rate.
However, many such mechanisms have been described before \cite{Nomura1984}.
We stress that the model does not contradict the existence of such mechanisms.
Ribosomal proteins expression control mechanisms may still be needed to achieve faster response under changing environmental conditions or a tighter regulation to avoid unnecessary production and reduce translational noise.
Furthermore, such mechanisms may be crucial for synchronizing the amount of rRNA with ribosomal proteins as the two go through different bio-synthesis pathways.
Nevertheless, the fact that many non-ribosomal proteins share the same response as ribosomal proteins do, poses interesting questions regarding the scope of such control mechanisms, their necessity and the trade-offs involved in their deployment.

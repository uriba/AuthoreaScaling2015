\section{Introduction}
A fundamental system-level challenge for cell physiology is the achievement of proper function in the face of various environmental conditions.
It has been established for many years that in different environments cells differ in many properties, including their shape, size, growth rate, and macro-molecular composition \cite{Schaechter1958,Maaloe1969,Churchward1982,Pedersen1978a,ingraham1983growth,Bremer1987}, with strong interdependence between these parameters.

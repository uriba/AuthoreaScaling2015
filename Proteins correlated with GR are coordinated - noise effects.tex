To understand whether the observed distribution is coordinated, and can result from the noise levels present in the data, we calculated, for every protein, the standard error with respect to the regression line that best fits its concentrations.
Given these standard errors we generated the expected distribution of slopes that would result by conducting our analysis on proteins that share a single, identical slope, but with the calculated noise in measurement.
The expected distribution is shown in gray line in Figure \ref{fig:globalfit} (Further details on the calculation as well as the deviation in maxima between the expected and observed distributions are discussed in the SI).

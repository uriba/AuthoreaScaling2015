\subsection{Analysis of proteomic data sets}
Our theoretical model predicts that the fraction of many proteins proportionally and coordinately scales up with the growth rate across different growth conditions.
To assess the extent to which this prediction is reflected in actual proteome compositions, we analyzed two published proteomics data sets of \emph{E.coli}, \cite{Peebo_2015} and \cite{Heinemann2015}.
These data sets use mass spectrometry to evaluate the proteomic composition of \emph{E.coli} under \vConds{} different growth rates using an accelerostat \cite{Paalme_1995}, and \hConds{} different growth conditions, spanning both different carbon sources and chemostat-controlled growth rates, respectively.
The data set from \cite{Heinemann2015} contains more conditions than those analyzed below, see section \ref{heinemanncond} for further details.

\subsection{Analysis of proteomic data sets}
To assess the extent to which the predictions of our model are reflected in actual proteome compositions, we analyzed two published proteomics data sets of \emph{E.coli}, \cite{Valgepea2013} and \cite{Heinemann2014}.
These data sets use mass spectrometry to evaluate the proteomic composition of \emph{E.coli} under $5$ different growth rates using a chemostat, in \cite{Valgepea2013}, and $19$ different growth conditions, spanning both different carbon sources and chemostat-controlled growth rates, in \cite{Heinemann2014}.
The data set from \cite{Heinemann2014} contains more conditions than those analyzed below, see section \ref{heinemanncond} for further details.

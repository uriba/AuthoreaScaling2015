\subsection{Analysis of proteomic data sets}
To examine the interdependence of protein concentration and growth rate across expressed genes we analyzed two published proteomics data sets of \emph{E.coli}, \cite{Valgepea2013} and \cite{Heinemann2014}.
These data sets use mass spectrometry to evaluate the proteomic composition of \emph{E.coli} under $5$ different growth rates using a chemostat, in \cite{Valgepea2013}, and $19$ different growth conditions, spanning both different carbon sources and chemostat-controlled growth rates, in \cite{Heinemann2014}.
The \cite{Heinemann2014} data set contains more conditions than those analyzed below, see section \ref{heinemanncond} for further details.

\subsubsection{Growth rate is the combined outcome of proteome composition and environmental conditions}
While it is sometimes implied that different cellular components are regulated by the growth rate, our model describes the growth rate as an outcome of the environmental conditions that affect the proteome composition.
Specifically, we assume that the doubling time is proportional to the ratio of the total amount of proteins per cell and the proteins involved in bio-synthesis in that cell.
The larger the ratio of total proteins to bio-synthesis proteins is, the longer these bio-synthesis proteins will need to duplicate the proteome, resulting in a longer doubling time.

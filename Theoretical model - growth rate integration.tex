\subsubsection{Growth rate is the combined outcome of proteome composition and environmental conditions}
While it is sometimes implied that different cellular components are regulated by the growth rate, here we consider the growth rate as an outcome of the environmental conditions that affect the proteome composition.
Specifically, we assume that the doubling time is proportional to the ratio of the total amount of proteins per cell and the amount of bio-synthesis machinery in that cell.
The larger the ratio of total proteins to bio-synthesis proteins is, the longer these bio-synthesis proteins will have to operate in order to duplicate the proteome, and thus the longer the doubling time of the cell will be.

The framework we present emphasizes the importance of accounting for global factors, that are reflected in the growth rate, when analyzing gene expression and proteomics data.
Specifically, we suggest that the default response of a protein (that is, the change in the observed expression of a protein, given that no specific regulation was applied to it) is to linearly increase with growth rate.
We point out that, as non-differentially regulated proteins maintain their relative abundances, one can deduce the parameters of the linear increase with growth rate of any non-differentially regulated protein by observing the scaling of other such proteins and fixing the ratio between the protein of interest and the reference proteins, as is demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:randpred}.

Our results, showing that a large number of proteins maintain their relative concentrations across different growth conditions thus extend the scope of similar results obtained for \emph{S.cerevisiae} in \cite{Keren2013a} and for expression levels in \emph{E.coli} under stress conditions \cite{Kaneko2014}.
In contrast to other approaches, our model suggests a mechanism for this coordinated expression changes that is not based on shared transcription factors but rather is a result of passive redistribution of resources.

\subsection{Ribosomal proteins scale similarly to non-ribosomal proteins that are strongly positively correlated with growth rate}
Comparing the normalized sum of ribosomal proteins to the normalized sum of the positively correlated with growth rate proteins that are non-ribosomal shows that these two groups scale in the same way with the growth rate, as is seen in Figure \ref{fig:ribsnonribs}

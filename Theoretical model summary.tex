To summarize, our theoretical model predicts that the default behavior of non-differentially regulated proteins between two conditions is to maintain a fraction that is proportional to the growth rate.
The faster the growth rate, the higher the fraction.
Such proteins should maintain their relative concentrations w.r.t. each other.
Degradation and changes in rates of molecular machineries at slow growth result in predicting non-zero fraction for such proteins even when the growth rate is zero, resulting in a more moderate response of the fraction to the growth rate.

To summarize, our theoretical model predicts that the default behavior of non-differentially regulated proteins between two conditions is to maintain a concentration that is proportional to the growth rate.
The faster the growth rate, the higher the concentration.
Such proteins should maintain their relative concentrations w.r.t. each other.
Degradation and changes in rates of molecular machineries at slow growth result in predicting non-zero concentration for such proteins even when the growth rate is zero.

To conclude, we observe that $\approx 9\%$ of the change in the proteome composition across conditions is the result of scaling with growth rate of many proteins.
Further discussion of the fraction of variability explained can be found in \ref{corrthreshold}.
This scaling with growth rate is coordinated, meaning the proteins maintain their relative abundances.
Finally, this fraction of proteins encompasses many proteins from different functional groups and cellular mechanisms.
